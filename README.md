# Good (Truck) Driver Incentive Program

## Project Description

This project is a minimum viable product (MVP) software application for the trucking industry designed to incentivize improvement of road safety from truck drivers. 

This is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that can be marketed to companies that hire truck drivers, and who are referred to as sponsors below. Like most reward programs, the user earns points for engaging in a desired behavior. To encourage better driving, the sponsor companies can award points to drivers for behaviors that they want to encourage, and possibly deduct points for bad behaviors. This application allows the sponsors to maintain a catalog of products from which the drivers can redeem their points.
