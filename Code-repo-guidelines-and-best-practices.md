## Master Branch
Developer code should always be cloned from the `master` branch. A developer may create feature branches in their local development environment, but any changes should be merged, stashed, or otherwise resolved into their local `master` branch prior to pushing to the online `master` repo. 

### Segmentation of Work
The easiest way to avoid problems with merge conflicts is to maintain separation of work areas. The project responsibilities should be discussed at the Sprint Meeting and a clear division of work agreed upon for the week so that each developer works only on their areas of the repo.

## Weekly Code Pulls

All developers will resolve their local branches and be ready to push to `master` during the Tuesday Sprint Meeting. 

**If all developers have correctly resolved local merge conflicts there should be no master conflicts.**

 After all developers have pushed, the project manager will tag the online repo with that week's Sprint Tag. Once complete, all developers should do a fresh pull to their local master and create that week's local development branch.

### Sprint Branch Naming 
It is always a good idea to give a branch a descriptive rather than cryptic name. A suggested format is:
```
jwb4_sprint03_api05
```
Here, the prefix is the first 4 digits of the developer's CUID, the middle is the sprint, and the suffix is a descriptor of the work being done for this branch.
